Dementia Virtual Memory App
===========================

****************
Task description
****************

- The Dementia app aims to help the affected individuals by tracking the fluctuations in their mood. Caregivers can use the app to maintain a photo album of the patient’s life and loved ones. The app also lets the user store descriptions along with the photographs. The caregiver can use the ‘about me’ section of the app to store information about the patient. Since Dementia primarily affects the elderly, this app also features a text-to-speech function to make it more user friendly.

- In this system, the user will have to register & login into the system. This system is for a person who is suffering from Dementia. User will have someone who will add photos & details about it directly in the database and in the photos section, the user can view and listen to the description about his family or where he lives etc. System uses text to Speech. User can also add or edit details about himself, so whenever he clicks on about me, the system will speak it out. Users also have a mood selector option, which will be spoken when the app is opened.
